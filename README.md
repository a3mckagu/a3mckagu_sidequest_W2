## Project Title

## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms, foreground tree elements, and an illustrated background. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle with multiple spirals in a cartoon-like style that grows when it approaches the top of the canvas. The blob also collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable. Text instructs users to face their fears and try to reach the moon, or retreat into the foreground trees -- evoking feelings of panic.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.
Code additions have been made by Andreea McKague but she used GenAI to write the comments
and submitted a Process and Documentation document for transparency and fairness.
